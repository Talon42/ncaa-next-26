This folder contains the default button graphics for the game. The default is Playstation. 

If you prefer Xbox, perform the following steps:

1. Unzip the Xbox buttons.zip file located in replacements/user-customs/controller.
   Keep them there. Do not move them. 

2. "Disable" the default playstation textures (do not remove them!) located here (in 
   replacements/controller/playstation) by adding a dash to the front of each file's
   name (eg. change "file.png" to "-file.png"). 
   
   You can do this manually or use the Textures Disabler script to do it for you, if you like.


IMPORTANT: It's critical you do it this new way because if not, your changes will 
           be undone the next time you run the Textures Sync.
